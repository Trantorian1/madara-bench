# Run with `nix-build`. This will generate an installation script as
# `./result/bin/copyto` which can then be executed to bring the generate docker 
# image `.tar.gz` into the current directory. This can then be loaded into
# docker using `docker load -i image.tar.gz`.

# otherwise as only root has ownership of artifacts generated in `/nix/store/`.

# Make on each run, along with any other command associated to their generation
